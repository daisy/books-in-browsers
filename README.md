## About 

Transform EPUB with Media Overlays into a series of HTML files for reading directly in the browser. 

A typical conversion creates the following files (see an [example fileset](https://github.com/daisy/accessible-books-in-browsers/tree/main/demos/moby-dick)):
- HTML files with the original contents, plus reading interface controls and links to the TOC, Previous, and Next pages.
- An About page containing publication metainformation
- A TOC based on the original EPUB Nav Document

Media Overlays conversion adds the following:
- Creation of one audio file per HTML page
- Embedding that audio file in the HTML page
- A VTT file containing the phrase timing information for that audio file

## Demos

Viewing these requires an up to date browser, specifically because they use [CSS Custom Highlights](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSS_Custom_Highlight_API#browser_compatibility) and [`autoplay` permissions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSS_Custom_Highlight_API#browser_compatibility).

To autoplay the contents from chapter to chapter, go to the page and then go to "site settings" in your browser. Under "audio", say "allow". You only have to do this once for the whole demo site (per domain).

* [Moby Dick](https://daisy.github.io/accessible-books-in-browsers/demos/moby-dick)

These demos were created using this [conversion script](https://github.com/daisy/accessible-books-in-browsers/tree/main/convert).

## Caveats

### Conversion
A few things (navigation document consistency across publications; colors in stylesheets or things marked `!important`) were adjusted manually in the EPUB source; this is, after all, just a prototype. But these aspects can and will be automated in the future.


## Approach

Generate a set of HTML pages:
* Target DAISY 2.02 content which has been automatically converted to EPUB 3
* Use an HTML template prepopulated with the basic structure of our pages (intra-publication links, audio if applicable)
* For each EPUB HTML spine item (except for the TOC), move the contents of `<body>` into the HTML template's `<main>` element.
* Generate a navigation file based on the EPUB navigation document
* Generate an About file containing publication information
* The cover page is renamed `index.html` and can act as an entry page (though a user can enter the publication from any page)
* Add links to each heading for easy bookmarking

Add javascript enhancements:
* Sidebar with table of contents, page list, search, and about tabs
* Settings panel to control visual adjustments and audio preferences
* Audio playback with synchronized highlighting
* Keyboard shortcuts

What this isn't:
* An authoring format definition
* A generic "player" to apply to any EPUB
